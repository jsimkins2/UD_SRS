This is the operational script folder for the downloading and processing of JPL GHRSST GOES-16 SST data product. We download this data, curate it, and serve it on thredds and erddap. Henceforth known as the JPL GOES SST product, this data product is now the primary goes16 sst product of the ORB lab. It performed the best of any satellite we currently have access to during the buoy validation tests. The backfill scripts are used in the case we have a major data outage (a couple of weeks +). We also download raw NOAA GOES-16 data. This is located in said folder and is currently only used for the spike filter product.
